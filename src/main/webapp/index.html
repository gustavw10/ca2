        <h3>Gruppe 9</h3>
        
        <h4>Phase one (Monday 19/10-Tuesday 20/10): </h4>
        <p>
            The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.<br>
            The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).<br>
            The CI-pipeline must be setup<br>
            Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests<br>
            Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Phase two (Wednesday 21/10-Thursday 22/10):</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the Entity Classes should be ready<br>
            Sample data should be available in the dev-database<br>
            Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Phase three (Friday 23/10 - Sunday 25/10):</h4>
        <p>
            Complete the API (as much as you have time for)<br>
            Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like:<br>
            Get all persons with a given hobby<br>
            Get all phone numbers for a person living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)<br>
            Get the number of people with a given hobby<br>
            Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark<br>
            Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)<br>
            Edit a Person to change hobbies and phone number etc.<br>
            Complete documentation and prepare for your review presentation Monday 23rd.
